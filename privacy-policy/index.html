<title>Awful Privacy Policy</title>

<h1>Awful Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Awful consists entirely of the code hosted at <a href="https://github.com/Awful/Awful.app">Awful's GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>Awful communicates with the servers hosting <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com">The Something Awful Forums</a> in order to log you in, download posts, and send your messages. Your password is kept in memory just long enough to log you in and is immediately forgotten.</p>

<p>Awful periodically and without your interaction downloads updated thread tags from <a href="http://awfulapp.com/tags.txt">awfulapp.com</a>. To prevent this periodic activity, go to the "Settings" tab and turn off the "Show Thread Tags" setting. Neither your username nor any other identifying information is involved in this process.</p>

<p>Awful periodically downloads updated theme stylesheets from <a href="http://awfulapp.com/posts-view-style.css">awfulapp.com</a>. This download is triggered when viewing posts in a thread. Neither your username or any other identifying information is involved in this process.</p>

<p><s>If</s>When Awful crashes, a log of the crash may be sent to Apple and available to Awful developers in an aggregate, anonymized form. Crash logs include information about whether your device is an iPhone or an iPad and which version of iOS is installed. Neither your username nor any other identifying information is included.</p>

<p>All other communication occurs solely under your direction. This includes loading images linked in posts or visiting websites in the Awful Browser.</p>

<p>When you log out of Awful, all cached data is immediately deleted. No identifying information is left behind on your device.</p>

<p>When you <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/account.php?action=editpassword">change your password on The Something Awful Forums</a>, Awful will automatically log you out on all devices where you are currently logged in.</p>
